# Moments
## _Return to those happy moments in your life._

Save laughs and memories without cluttering your bookmarks or folders. Return to them any time you're feeling glum!

Use the app or widget to add images, links, and text to your Moments jar whenever you want. You can also share content directly through your browser and gallery. This will then be hidden away until you choose to take a random one out. Zero distractions, zero fuss. Moments gives you an easy way to save what you know you want to return to, but don't know when. 

On your next rainy day, cheer yourself up with a forgotten moment!
